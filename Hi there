You should be proud of the work you have done with the c328 caméra.

I suggest, Altouth it's been a while to refresh the whole thing around the ESP8266 device it's pretty much all work up, and the work done so far can be found at:

https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino

Also, I can see that your work can be compatibilized with some other serial caméra, maybe you could do a wrapt up version of your library. And if I may, I could add some example.

Any ways, it's your project,you are the one to decide who work for it. ;) 

Cheer mate And Thank you very much for your efforts.
